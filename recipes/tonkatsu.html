        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb pork tenderloin or center cut boneless pork chops</li>
            <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
            <li>1 Egg, whipped (add additional egg if needed)</li>
            <li>1 - 2 cups panko or breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut and, if necessary, pound pork into desired thickness, between a half and three quarters of an inch
                thick.</li>
            <li>Place flour, whipped egg, and panko into three separate bowls. Into the flour, liberally mix in salt and
                pepper.</li>
            <li>Dredge each piece of pork in flour, then coat in the whipped egg, and lastly cover with panko, gently
                pressing the breadcrumbs into the wet egg to adhere.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan with oil on medium high. Fry the breaded pork until golden brown on both sides, and the pork
                is
                cooked through. Alternatively, deep fry the pork in a deep frier. Remove from the oil and place on a
                paper
                towel lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Serve with rice, thinly sliced shredded cabbage, miso soup, and tonkatsu sauce.
