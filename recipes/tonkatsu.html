    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy out the outside, tender on the inside, and accompanied by refreshing raw cabbage and tangy tonkatsu sauce,
        this simple, but comforting dish is perfect for any occasion.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb pork tenderloin or center cut boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 Egg, whipped (add additional egg if needed)</li>
        <li>1 - 2 cups panko or breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut and, if necessary, pound pork into desired thickness, between a half and three quarters of an inch
            thick.</li>
        <li>Place flour, whipped egg, and panko into three separate bowls. Into the flour, liberally mix in salt and
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge each piece of pork in flour, then coat in the whipped egg, and lastly cover with panko, gently
            pressing the breadcrumbs into the wet egg to adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan with oil on medium high. Fry the breaded pork until golden brown on both sides, and the pork is
            cooked through. Alternatively, deep fry the pork in a deep frier. Remove from the oil and place on a paper
            towel lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve with rice, thinly sliced shredded cabbage, miso soup, and tonkatsu sauce. Itadakimasu!</p>
