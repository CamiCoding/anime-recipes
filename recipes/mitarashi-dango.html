        <ul>
            <li>200 g Dangoko (Japanese rice dumpling flour)</li>
            <li>140-150 ml water</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>150 ml water (roughly â…” cup)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the skewers in water. You can start boiling a large pot of water on low heat.</li>
            <li>Add Dangoko in a bowl, and stir in cold water slowly while mixing with chopsticks.</li>
            <li>Combine the rice into one ball.</li>
            <li>Knead until the dough becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>Make the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Then divide each piece into 2 balls. You will have 16 equal-sized balls.</li>
            <li>Shape them into nice smooth round balls.</li>
            <li>When the water is boiling, drop each dumpling into the pot with a continuous motion.</li>
            <li>Dumplings will stay on the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook an
                additional
                1-2 minute.</li>
            <li>Transfer them into iced water after they are done cooking.</li>
            <li>Once the dumplings are cooled, drain well and transfer to a wet tray.</li>
            <li>Skewer three pieces into a bamboo skewer and do this step for the rest of the balls too.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Steps to make the Sweet Soy Glaze</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sugar, mirin, soy sauce, water, and potato starch or cornstarch in a saucepan without turning on
                the
                heat.</li>
            <li>Mix it all together, then turn on the heat and continue to whisk.</li>
            <li>After the sauce becomes thick and heavy, stop the whisking, turn off the heat and transfer it to a bowl.
            </li>
        </ol>
