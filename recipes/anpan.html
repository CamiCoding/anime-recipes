    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Anpan is a slightly sweet bread that's similar to brioche, which is most commonly filled with anko, or sweet red
        bean paste. Sweet and filling, anpan makes for a great meal, whether it's as a quick breakfast, a special
        afternoon snack, or a satisfying dessert. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>7 oz. (3/4 + 2 tbsp) warm milk</li>
        <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>18 oz (2 1/2 cups) anko, (find the recipe for anko <a
                href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-anko-red-bean-paste/">here</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide anko into 12 equal pieces and, using the palms of your hands, roll each piece into balls. Cover and
            place in the fridge until needed.</li>
        <li>Dissolve sugar and yeast in the warm milk. Beat 2 eggs, butter, salt, and milk mixture together until well
            combined, either by hand or using the paddle attachment on a standing mixer.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, one cup at a time, to the wet ingredients, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure the
            flour is incorporated.</li>
        <li>If using a standing mixer, switch to the dough hook and mix until the dough comes together to form a ball.
            If working by hand, turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead by hand until it forms into a
            ball.</li>
        <li>Continue kneading the dough on a floured work surface until supple and shiny.</li>
        <li>Place in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place (such as in the oven with the
            light on) until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough in the bowl, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 12 equal
            pieces. Form each piece into balls by tucking the top of the dough underneath to create a taut surface.
            Cover with a damp, lint-free towel, and let rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>To shape the anpan, gently flatten a ball of dough into a disk. Place a ball of anko into the center of the
            dough and then gently pull the sides of the dough up and around the anko, pinching it closed at the top,
            sealing it completely.</li>
        <li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, seam side down, spacing the unbaked anpan about 2.5 inches
            apart. Using the palm of your hand, gently flatten the unbaked anpan slightly. Press down in the center of
            the bun with a finger to create an indent.</li>
        <li>Place in a warm place for 50 minutes, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Just before baking, lightly beat the remaining egg in a bowl, and then gently brush onto the buns. Garnish
            with sesame seeds if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 350 F. for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. Place the baked anpan on a wire
            rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve with milk, tea, or coffee. Itadakimasu!</p>
